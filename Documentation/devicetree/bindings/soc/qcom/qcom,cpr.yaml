title: Qualcomm Core Power Reduction (CPR)

description: |
  CPR (Core Power Reduction) is a technology to reduce core power on a CPU
  or other device. Each OPP of a device corresponds to a "corner" that has
  a range of valid voltages for a particular frequency. While the device is
  running at a particular frequency, CPR monitors dynamic factors such as
  temperature, etc. and suggests adjustments to the voltage to save power
  and meet silicon characteristic requirements.
